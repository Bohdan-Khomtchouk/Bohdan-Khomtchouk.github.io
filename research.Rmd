title: "Background"

My lab's research program at UChicago concerns the emerging field of cardioinformatics, working at the nexus of bioinformatics and precision cardiology.  My principal research focus is on creating large-scale computational infrastructure and algorithms for powering the world's cardiovascular disease (CVD) data at a massive scale and mining new insights from it -- working at the multidisciplinary interface of healthcare, algorithm design, software engineering, integrative bioinformatics, multi-omics, natural language processing, and statistical learning.  

Previously, I was an American Heart Association (AHA) Postdoctoral Fellow working in the field of computational biology and cardiovascular medicine in the Gozani and Assimes Labs at Stanford University. My primary faculty advisor was Or Gozani MD, PhD (Department of Biology, Stanford University), and my secondary faculty mentor was Themistocles Assimes MD, PhD, FRCPC, FAHA (Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Stanford University School of Medicine). While at Stanford, I was involved in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Whole Genome Sequencing Program (Atherosclerosis Working Group), which represented the largest subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease study to date (101,295 human genomes), and I served as a Research Associate in the VA Palo Alto Healthcare System working on CVD in the Million Veteran Program. I also started Quiltomics (http://www.quiltomics.com) and the Stanford R Group (http://www.stanfordr.com/).

**Research highlights in my portfolio include:**

- Creating the world's largest CVD data commons platform (https://www.heartbioportal.com and https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002426)

- Computationally discovering and experimentally validating the epigenetic basis and biological mechanism behind the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning (https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.116.004076)

- Writing the world's fastest biological heatmap software (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176334)

- Designing the first cross-platform desktop GUI application for biological heatmaps (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13029-014-0030-2)

- Showing that neural networks are essentially just polynomial regression in disguise (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850)

- Finding that drinking too much alcohol leads to the loss of an epigenetic enzyme (PRDM2) in the brain, which leads to loss of impulse control, which leads to alcoholism (https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2016131)

- Supporting the Lisp programming community (https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw130 and http://med.miami.edu/news/miller-school-researchers-help-push-the-limits-of-programming-languages-in-)

- Writing more heatmap software, can you tell I like heatmaps? (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1260-x)

- TBA -- lots of unpublished preprints (website likely not up-to-date)
