title: "Background"
---

I am an American Heart Association (AHA) Postdoctoral Fellow working in the field of computational epigenetics and cardiovascular medicine in the Gozani and Assimes Labs at Stanford University. My postdoctoral research concerns the emerging field of cardioinformatics, working at the nexus of bioinformatics and cardiology. My primary faculty advisor is Or Gozani MD, PhD (Department of Biology, Stanford University), and my secondary faculty mentor is Themistocles Assimes MD, PhD, FRCPC, FAHA (Department of Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Stanford University School of Medicine). 

My principle research focus is on creating artificial intelligence and machine learning software to organize and better understand the world's cardiovascular disease data at a massive scale -- working at the multidisciplinary interface of healthcare, integrative bioinformatics, multi-omics, natural language processing, and statistical learning. I am also involved in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Whole Genome Sequencing Program (Atherosclerosis Working Group), which represents the largest subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease study to date (101,295 human genomes), and I serve as a Research Associate in the VA Palo Alto Healthcare System working on the Million Veterans Project. I am also a co-founder of Quiltomics (http://www.quiltomics.com) and president of the Stanford R Group (http://www.stanfordr.com/).

**Research highlights in my portfolio include:**

- Quilting together the world's cardiovascular disease data (http://www.heartbioportal.com and https://doi.org/10.1101/487744)

- Writing the world's fastest biological heatmap software (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176334)

- Designing the first cross-platform desktop GUI application for biological heatmaps (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13029-014-0030-2)

- Showing that neural networks are essentially just polynomial regression in disguise (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850)

- Finding that drinking too much leads to the loss of an epigenetic enzyme (PRDM2) in the brain, which leads to loss of impulse control, which leads to alcoholism (https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2016131)

- Revealing the epigenetic basis behind the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning (https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.116.004076)

- Supporting the Lisp community (https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw130)

- Writing more heatmap software, can you tell I like heatmaps? (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1260-x)

- TBA -- lots of unpublished preprints (website likely not up-to-date)
